# Fun with Morse code
This project implemented a solution for translating a text message to a Morse code message and from a Morse code message to a text message.
First you can enter the text message you want to translate. The solution supports Latin letters and numbers, you can also enter some punctuation marks, 
but after conversion they will be ignored. You will then be prompted to enter the Morse code, it will be translated into a text message.
